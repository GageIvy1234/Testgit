<p> Minecraft is an infinite world, which means that the distance between you and your location can be extremely far.
     How do I make traveling between points faster? In the end of Minecraft you can obtain an elytra which lets you fly, but this 
     is at the end of the game, which means this will not be easily obtained. There are minecarts, but they are very expensive and also not very fast. What can I do? 
    </p>
   <P>Minecraft has a dimension called the Nether where 8 block in the overworld is equal to 1 block in the Nether. 
    Making multiple portals at locations you constantly go to will save you so much time. 
    Itâ€™s  necessary to have a Nether Hub when playing with friends, so how do you make a portal and how do I link portals ?
     You will need obsidian, which you will need a diamond pickaxe to mine. You need to make an  obsidian frame (4*5 minimum, 23*23 maximum), 
     after making  the frame, light with flint and steel (one iron ingot and one piece of flint).  To link the portals, build one in the overworld and get your x and z coordinates, 
     turn those coordinates into the Nether version and build and light a portal and now they are linked!
     How do 
    I get my  Nether coordinates? Just divide coordinates by 8 or use my calculator below!

<p>
    Put in your X and Z  Overworld coordinates and it will convert it into nether Coordinates! You dont need Y coordinate because the Nether Portal will link with different Y coordinate.
    Please put in a number and not a letter! Push submit when you are done putting in your X and Z coordinates and below it will be your Nether coordinate. On the Java version of Minecraft you have to press F3 to 
    enter visual mode, your x and z will be in the middle left.
    On Bedrock Edition you need to turn on coordinate in the world settings and they will appear in the top  right side of your screen, the one to the far left is your x, the one in the middle is your y, and your z is the far right one.
